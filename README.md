# terraform-study

This is a Testing repository for Terraform. I use it to push what i've made and save the commits to check later.

The providers that I used so far are GCP and Azure.

On this moment, the azure script creates a linux VM and creates a docker container that runs an api made in python with Flask, then outputs its public IP address.

It also creates a GCE and runs the same api as the Azure one, but I didn't get it to be accessible by an external IP address.
